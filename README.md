# Popflash Stats Getter

## What is this Project?
This project started as a way to create a leaderboard for CS:GO tenmans run through my Alma Matter.  This script is intended to take in a column which contains links to [Popflash](https://popflash.site/) matches.  The script wrangles data from the matches to create a leaderboard of player stats, averaging and adding where needed.

## Setup Your Own Spreadsheet
Make a copy of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HyFqA0Sem-Oj_Emj1QNbfDU_MRoNiEoNbbDj6woSdeE/edit?usp=sharing) to your own Google Drive folder.  Make edits to the spreadsheet as necessary, making sure to put the match links in the correct column.  Layout changes to the spreadsheet may require changes to the script in order for it to work.
