# Popflash Stats Getter

## What is this Project?
This project started as a way to create a leaderboard for CS:GO tenmans run through my Alma Matter.  This script is intended to take in a column which contains links to [Popflash](https://popflash.site/) matches.  The script wrangles data from the matches to create a leaderboard of player stats, averaging and adding where needed.

## Setup Your Own Spreadsheet
Make a copy of [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HyFqA0Sem-Oj_Emj1QNbfDU_MRoNiEoNbbDj6woSdeE/edit?usp=sharing) to your own Google Drive folder.  Make edits to the spreadsheet as necessary, making sure to put the match links in the correct column.  Layout changes to the spreadsheet may require changes to the script in order for it to work.

Once a copy of the spreadsheet has been made, populate it with the match links you want to create a leaderboard for.  Then you can click on the  `Update Stats` button to create/update the leaderboard.  If you want the leaderboard to be sorted a certain way, select a category cell on the leaderboard and click the `Sort by Selected Column` button.  This will sort the leaderboard however you would like.
